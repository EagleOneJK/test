In order for our pre-made queries to work \"out-of-the-box\" we need to know how the fields used by those queries are indexed in Kibana.\n\nThe instructions under Methodology are for *manually* finding and report the field types (a script is in the works). \n\nThe process requires you to make a query to the Elastic API from Kibana and interpret the ouput which is in JSON format. There are plenty of resources online to learn more about JSON, but the essentials for this task are as follows:\n- JSON is formatted in key/value pairs surrounded by curly braces: `{ \"key\" : \"value\" }`\n- Values can be further key/value pairs which creates a nested format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"winlogbeat-2024.06.17-000004\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"event.code\" : {\n        \"full_name\" : \"event.code\",\n        \"mapping\" : {\n          \"code\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"keyword\",\n            \"ignore_above\" : 1024\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n- Your query will be matching on the `\"full_name\"` key, and the `\"type` key nested below it holds the *value* to report.\n\n\n### Methodology:\n\n\n##### 1. Setup\n1. Download `Common_Kibana_Fields.md` from the `Scripts/Tools` folder in the GitLab project for this sortie.\n2. Log into Kibana using the ***elastic*** credentials on the DIP Portal page (right below the Kibana link).\n3. On the left side bar, scroll to the bottom and click on *Dev Tools*\n    - *On this page, the left pane is the query Console and the right pane is output*\n4. Open the `.md` file and Kibana side by side.\n\n##### 2. Extract Data\n1. Clear any text in the console field on the left and enter the the command below, then CTRL+Enter or click the green play button to run the query.\n    - `GET /winlogbeat/_mapping/field/key.value`\n    - `GET /winlogbeat/_mapping/field/key.key.value`\n    > The output will be in a nested format (JSON), where each chunk of data represents a single \"shard\" of the complete `winlogbeat-*` index. Every shard should contain the same data for the purposes of this task.\n    > *For more context on the output format, search the web for \"JSON format\"*\n2. In the first chunk of data, look for the `\"type\" : \"keyword/text\"` line (should be line 8).\n3. Copy/Paste this value (`keyword` , `text` , `ip` ...) into the `.md` on the appropriate line under the \"Type\" header.\n> If a valid query does not return results (returns `mappings\" : { }`), enter \"Not Found\" in the `.md` file.\n4. Repeat steps 2.1 - 2.3 for each field in the `.md` file\n\n##### 2. Alternate Method to Extract Data\n1. Login with user/password listed on Controller Portal for Kibana - normal accounts do not have approprite privileges to view mappings\n2. Click on the hamburger in the top left\n3. Scroll down to `Stack Management`\n4. Click on `Index Management`\n5. Click on `Index Templates`\n6. Search for `winlogbeat`\n7. Under \"Legacy index templates\" click on `winlogbeat`\n8. Go to `Mappings`\n9. Copy all data within `Mappings`\n10. In order to maintain data formatting, open Visual Studio and paste copied 'Mappings' data into new file .\n11. Save file as /home/assessor/Desktop/Common_Kibana_Fields.md\n12. Select All (CTRL-A), right click --> Format Document, then Save\n\n\n\n##### 3. Upload to GitLab\n1. Navigate to the GitLab project for this sortie and click on the `Kibana_Field_Map.md` file to view it.  If the file is not there, skip to step 3.\n2. If file exists, in the toolbar above the file contents, click \"Replace\", then select or drop your updated file and click \"Replace File\"\n3. If file does not exist, upload file to project and submit merge request to have file added to main branch.\n4. Once request is approved, get link to file in main branch and post as \"Result Link\" below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Place any improvements or updated instructions/tips/strategies for completing this task in the future into the OVERVIEW section - above this line BEFORE the Event Collected section.

Alert ended up being accurate, malware beacon was identified via network analyzer\n\n### Enable hardening recommendation:\n\nMP Should purchase NIPS and set rules to DROP for known bad malware\n\n### Successes:\n\nEase of use via Kibana preconfigured dashboard\n\n### Challenges/Opportunities to improve:\n\nTask should be expanded upon or a new CTT task needs to be created to tune Suricata alerts during Chara. phase", "custom_attributes": {}, "task_uuid": "40a5c03a-110e-48eb-af05-8b4dd54a223b", "id": 1, "task_assignees": [{"user": "honie.phillip", "name": "honie.phillip", "id": 5}]}], "comments": [{"comment_id": 1, "comment_uuid": "28649842-d6b0-4f45-b523-75f7a0998812", "comment_text": "The existance of alerts indicating known malware on several DAL ips was reported to MEL.
